My name is Michael Dowd. I am living and working in Dublin, Ireland. I graduated from college with a degree in Engineering and Architecture, from which I draw an attention to detail and a love of simple geometry. My paintings demand attention and then reward the viewer with simple and elegant brushwork and a true sense of the subject.<br /><br />

I grew up in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland, surrounded by boats, the sea and a lovely mixture of people. When I want to relax I enjoy surfing, sailing, windsurfing, painting and writing music.<br /><br />

Art is a combination of technical skill and creativity. Some of my art allows more of one than the other but I aim always to be unique and true to a vision I'm trying to express. Recently I've been focusing on developing a bold and geometric style that can be integrated into portraiture. I aim for a sense of lightness and a confident expressive quality combined with an attention to detail and a capturing of the sense of the subject. My landscapes aim to be bold and demand attention, almost to the point of being obnoxious, but to ultimately reward the viewer with a beautiful and balanced experience that I think is lacking from a lot of art these days.<br /><br />
